Telemac2D simulations of the UK Shelf.

John Bacon - 23/03/2020

Originally built by David Haverson, modified by Claire Beraud  - a high
resolution model of the entire UK domain including the Celtic Sea, 
North Sea, English Channel. A high degree of detail around the whole 
coastline and particularly for the Western Isles and estuarine 
environments. Particular care taken in these shallow areas. The model
runs relatively quickly on 28 cores - say 2-3 hours for a 30 day run.
Validated originally - much work was carried out under the MERR projects 
to enable the model to be used to generate 30 day Harmonic Analyses for input
to the Emergency Response models.

It was also used for 300 day particle tracking runs for release of particle at 
9 stations  around the UK (as per paper by Elliot (1995)) and reported under 
C7265H - Defra report MERR2
