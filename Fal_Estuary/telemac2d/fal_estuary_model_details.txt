Telemac2D simulation of the Fal, Truro, Tressilian estuaries and
Falmouth Bay
=====================================================================
John Bacon - 23/03/2020

Model built for the C7244_Sea Food Tomorrow project (H2020)
The model is of of the river and estuarine system essentially but 
extends out to a sea boundary driven by TPXO. 
This model is the initial trial setup to get the tides working.
Some release of tracer was made as an experiment to examine the 
dispersal characteristics before developing the Telemac3D model.

Files included:
1. fal_meshE_2d_src_tpxo_3t.cast  steering file 3 tracers
2. meshE_geo_tpxo.slf
3. meshE_geo_tpxo_src_BC.cli
4. sources - 3 rivers + 1 effluent (STW) at Truro
