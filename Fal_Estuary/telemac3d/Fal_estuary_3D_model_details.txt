=====================================================================

=====================================================================
This model is the Telemac3D version of the Fal, Truro and Tressilian 
Estuary model. Very much based on the methods developed by Luz Garcia
for the Dartmouth E.coli sudy for Seedcorn C7244A.
3D Baroclinic mode with salinity and temperature.
Meteorology from ECMWF ERA5 Interim - single point giving 8 standard 
atmospheric variables.
Coupled with WAQTEL 
There are two sources possible - one with 3 river sources (Fal, Truro,
and Tressilian) plus 1 pollution outfall (Newnham STW) or a second version
with 4 sources (added Callenick Creek).
Decay on the E.coli possible using Implicit or explicit Decay method 
fortran_luz4.f is the explicit version and fortran_luz5.f the implicit
Boundary conditions from TPXO 
Source and discharge data from EA
